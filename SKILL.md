# Scene Over Summary

Technique for transforming summary writing into dramatized scenes with narrative power. Based on Robert Caro's approach to making history read like a novel.

---

## When to Use

- Writing reads like a list of events
- History or biography feels dry and academic
- Readers aren't engaging with the material
- Need to bring a moment to life
- Want to show rather than tell

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "My writing is boring"
- "This feels like a summary"
- "How do I make history come alive?"
- "It reads like a list of events"
- "It's too dry"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| content | Yes | The summary or timeline to transform |
| key_moment | No | The pivotal scene to focus on |
| source_material | No | Research that could provide detail |
| purpose | No | What this scene needs to accomplish |

---

## Core Principle

> "History should read like a novel."
> — Robert Caro

Caro doesn't write: "Robert Moses built many bridges and displaced communities."

He writes scenes: The morning Moses picked up the phone. The meeting where a governor realized he'd been outmaneuvered. The family standing in their doorway as the bulldozers approached.

Summary tells. Scene shows. Readers remember scenes.

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify the Pivotal Moment

Every historical development has a *moment*—not a trend, a moment. Find it.

**Not:** "Johnson rose to power in the Senate through coalition-building."

**The moment:** The exact meeting where Richard Russell first trusted Johnson. The vote where it all turned. The hallway conversation that sealed the deal.

**Ask:**
- When did everything change?
- What was the point of no return?
- What's the moment that explains everything after?

### Step 2: Gather Sensory Details

A scene requires:
- [ ] **Place** - Where exactly? What did it look like?
- [ ] **Time** - What day? What hour? What was happening in the world?
- [ ] **People** - Who was present? What did they look like, wear, sound like?
- [ ] **Objects** - What was on the desk? In their hands?
- [ ] **Atmosphere** - Hot? Cold? Tense? The smell of the room?

Caro went to the Texas Hill Country to understand the *feel* of Johnson's childhood. He could then write about the dust, the isolation, the poverty.

### Step 3: Find the Dialogue

Did anyone record what was said? Can you reconstruct from interviews?

**Sources for dialogue:**
- Contemporaneous notes or memos
- Letters written shortly after
- Interviews with participants
- Court transcripts
- Press coverage from the day

If exact dialogue isn't available, use Caro's technique: paraphrase clearly labeled, but written to capture the essence.

### Step 4: Build the Scene Structure

**Opening:** Ground us in place and time
- Physical setting
- What's at stake
- Who's present

**Action:** What happens in this moment
- The decision, confrontation, revelation
- The mechanism of power (what actually occurred)
- The human element (what people felt, thought)

**Consequence:** Why this moment mattered
- What changed because of this
- Who won, who lost
- What the reader now understands

### Step 5: Show the Mechanism

Caro's genius is showing *how*—not just what happened, but the mechanism by which it happened.

**Not:** "Moses got the bridge approved."

**The mechanism:** Who made the call, to whom, using what leverage, and why they couldn't refuse.

**Not:** "Johnson won Russell's loyalty."

**The mechanism:** Exactly how Johnson attached himself to Russell—sitting next to him, eating breakfast with him, becoming "Russell's boy"—and what Russell didn't realize until too late.

## The Transformation

### Before (Summary)

"Robert Moses was responsible for displacing hundreds of thousands of people through his highway projects, including the Cross-Bronx Expressway, which devastated the communities it cut through."

### After (Scene)

The letter came on a Tuesday. Mrs. Schwartz had lived on East Tremont Avenue for thirty-one years, raised three children in the apartment, buried her husband from the church on the corner.

The letter said she had ninety days.

She didn't know who Robert Moses was. She'd never heard of the Triborough Bridge Authority. But the letter explained that her building, her church, her corner grocery—all of East Tremont Avenue for twenty blocks—was now "in the path of progress."

At the community meeting that night, she listened to a young city planner explain that the highway could have gone through Crotona Park—through open land, displacing no one. But Mr. Moses had chosen this route instead. Why? The planner didn't know. No one knew. The decision had been made somewhere, by someone, and there was no appeal.

She had ninety days to find somewhere else to raise her grandchildren.

That's power. Not the power you read about in civics textbooks—the power of voters and elected officials. This was something else. This was a man who had never been elected to anything, deciding which neighborhoods would live and which would die.

## The Pattern

| Element | Summary Version | Scene Version |
|---------|-----------------|---------------|
| People | "Communities" | Mrs. Schwartz, 31 years |
| Time | "During construction" | The Tuesday the letter came |
| Place | "The Cross-Bronx area" | East Tremont Avenue, the corner church |
| Stakes | "Displacement" | 90 days to leave her home |
| Power | "Moses decided" | No appeal, no one knows why |

## Outputs

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Scene version | Dramatized rewrite of summary content |
| Moment identification | The pivotal instant to focus on |
| Detail needs | What additional research would enrich the scene |
| Mechanism explanation | The "how" that makes power visible |

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**User:** "I wrote this for a company history: 'In 2015, the company faced a critical decision about entering the European market. After much deliberation, leadership decided to proceed, which proved to be a turning point for the company's growth.' How do I make this less boring?"

**Scene Over Summary response:**

That's a summary. Let's find the scene.

**First, the questions:**

1. Who was in the room when this was decided?
2. What was the argument? Who wanted to go, who said no?
3. What was the moment—the meeting, the vote, the call?
4. What did they risk? What were they afraid of?
5. What did the room look like? What time of year?

**A possible scene structure:**

---

*The conference room had been built for eight. That morning, twelve people had crowded in, and the air conditioning couldn't keep up.*

*Sarah Chen stood at the whiteboard, the map of Europe behind her. She'd spent six weeks on this analysis, and she knew what happened next would define her career—or end it.*

*"Forty million in upfront costs," said Michael from Finance, not looking up from the spreadsheet. "We don't have that in reserve."*

*"We don't have it in reserve because we keep reserving it." Sarah tapped Frankfurt on the map. "Every quarter we have this conversation. Every quarter we say 'next year.' The window is now."*

*The room was silent. Everyone looked at the CEO.*

*He hadn't spoken in twenty minutes. He was looking at the photograph on the wall—the company's first office, 2008, three people and a dream.*

*"What do we lose if we wait another year?" he asked.*

*"The partnership with Müller Group. They won't wait."*

*Another silence. Then the CEO stood up.*

*"Book the flights."*

---

See the difference?

- **Specific people** with names and stakes
- **Physical details** (crowded room, photograph)
- **Conflict** (Finance vs. Expansion)
- **Tension** (the silence, the CEO not speaking)
- **The moment** (the decision itself)

Now: Who was actually in that room? What details can you gather from interviews? What was really at stake? That's where your scene lives.

## Integration

This skill pairs with:
- **turn-every-page-research** - Rich sources enable rich scenes
- **silence-interview-technique** - Interviews reveal scene details
- **power-analysis-lens** - Scenes should show power mechanisms

---

## Constraints

- Scene details must be researched, not invented
- If details are reconstructed, indicate clearly
- Balance scene with necessary context
- Not every moment deserves scene treatment
